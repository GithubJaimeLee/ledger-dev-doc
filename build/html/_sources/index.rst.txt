Ledger Documentation Hub
========================

.. note::

   This documentation is intended for developers only and not general users.

Ledger produces personal security devices such as the Ledger Nano S and the
Ledger Blue, both of which are architected around a Secure Element and the BOLOS
platform.

This documentation contains information about developing apps for these devices,
from high-level concepts like hierarchical deterministic key generation to
low-level details about the hardware architecture of these devices.
