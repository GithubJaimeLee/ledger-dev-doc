<h1>Publishing an Application<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing-an-application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Ledger Manager is the service which centralizes the distribution of <a class="reference internal" href="../bolos/introduction.html"><span class="doc">BOLOS</span></a> applications on Ledger devices. It is the place where both Ledger’s apps and third party apps are distributed to users.
This document aims at explaining the procedure for a third party app to be released on the Ledger Manager.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<img alt="../_images/manager.png" src="../_images/manager.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The Ledger Manager</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>First, let’s see the typical end-to-end architecture of a BOLOS application, in
the case of an app for a cryptocurrency:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<img alt="../_images/app_architecture.png" src="../_images/app_architecture.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">End-to-end architecture of a BOLOS application</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>In this example, 3 pieces of software are required:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A BOLOS application, written in C, running on a Ledger device</p></li>
<li><p>The companion app, with business logic and typically a GUI, running on a
computer or a phone connected to the Ledger device</p></li>
<li><p>A transaction explorer that interfaces between the front-end and the
cryptocurrency daemon, running either locally (in the case of a full node) or
remotely (light wallet)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not developing an app adding support for a cryptocurrency, then you
can ignore the 3rd piece. Depending on your use case, the companion app might be a simple daemon or a command line tool, without a GUI.
<em>The companion app should always be compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux</em></p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<img alt="../_images/bitcoin-live.png" src="../_images/bitcoin-live.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Ledger’s main companion app: the Ledger Live</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>When these pieces are ready for deployment, they must be sent to Ledger for
a security review. One of the things we’re going to do is review the security of the BOLOS
application code, and check that it functions as intended in conjunction with
its companion app. Here is a non-exhaustive list of what we’re looking at
during the review process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Backdoors</p></li>
<li><p>Buffer overflows</p></li>
<li><p>Correct use of the device (for example, minimizing <a class="reference internal" href="../userspace/memory.html#flash-memory-endurance"><span class="std std-ref">NVRAM wearing</span></a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Correct use of the SDK</p></li>
<li><p>Application stability, correct handling of errors</p></li>
<li><p>Correct usability (see <a class="reference internal" href="#design-guidelines">Design Guidelines</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Review time depends on Ledger’s available resources and code complexity. The
more unique and complex the code, the longer the review. Please note that forks
of supported BOLOS apps will require a new review. The decision to reject or
revoke an app is at Ledger’s sole discretion. We will make our best efforts to
provide a rationale for such decisions. Upon fixing identified issues, app
authors will be allowed to re-submit their apps.
A new all-in-one native app called <em>Ledger Live</em>
has been released on the 9th of July, 2018. This new platform will be open to
pull requests for adding support for new cryptocurrencies in the coming months,
<em>it is not available yet</em>. Currently, your best shot is to build your own companion
app with its own backend. It is less convenient for users than a full integration
to Ledger Live, but on the other hand, it gives you more freedom on the design
of the interface you want users to see, and the way it will be implemented
(Web app? Native app? It’s up to you!).</p>
<div class="section" id="design-guidelines">
<h2>Design Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#design-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The design of your device app will be added to our website to inform that your app is
available. In that respect, we thank you to provide us with the design in a format and
with measurements that shall meet the criteria communicated by our team.</p>
<p>There are 2 mandatory icons that should be provided for Ledger to release an app:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Device icon, displayed on the Nano S dashboard</p></li>
<li><p>The Manager icon, displayed in the Manager application list</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below are the Adobe Illustrator templates for such icons, please respect their guidance.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The color palette for Blue icons shall contain 16 colors maximum</p></li>
<li><p>The icon file shall not contain any alpha channel</p></li>
<li><p>In order to blend well with the Blue’s Dashboard background, the 4 rounded white corners of the blue icon shall be set to this RGB value:  #F9F9F9 (and not #FFFFFF)</p></li>
<li><p>Nano X icons must be 14x14 px in size. Developers can create their Nano X icons from the 16x16 px Nano S one with the following command: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">convert</span> <span class="pre">nanos_app_&lt;token&gt;.gif</span> <span class="pre">-crop</span> <span class="pre">14x14+1+1</span> <span class="pre">+repage</span> <span class="pre">-negate</span> <span class="pre">nanox_app_&lt;token&gt;.gif</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Click on each image to download the corresponding .ai file, and fill them directly before sending them back. They should correspond to the icons used to compile your app.</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Most of the time, Bolos apps expose few functionalities to the user. However,
despite this simplicity, it is still challenging to build a user-friendly
interface, because of the few inputs (only 2 buttons !) and also because of
the screen size which offer only 128*32 pixels.
Ledger provides some guidance to avoid third party developers to reinvent
the wheel.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference internal" href="../userspace/display_management.html"><span class="doc">BAGL Toolkit</span></a> for more information
on the BOLOS Application Graphics Library technical details.</p>
</div>
<p>Even though the screen is small, you don’t want to bloat it with plenty of tiny text
to fit everything in a single time. Instead, multiple successives screens are the
way to go, with a configurable time interval between each screen switch.
Doing this allows you to split and segment the information to display.
It is also a good practice to inform the user of what is the kind of information
currently displayed, by giving it a title.
In some cases, even when the information is segmented by type, there won’t be
enough space for it to fit entirely on screen. Rather than splitting this information
in multiple screens, it is better to use automatic scrolling display.
Here is an example that sums it up:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id6">
<img alt="../_images/scroll.gif" src="../_images/scroll.gif" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Example: transaction confirmation screen</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>On this example two pieces of information are shown: an amount of bitcoins, and a
destination address.
The two screens are alternating periodically until the user validates or cancel.
A title is present to describe each information. For the too-long-to-display destination
address, the automatic scrolling is used.</p>
<p>A few graphical pointers (glyphs) help users to make a link between the right and left
buttons and their effects.
There are four principal functions fulfilled by pressing buttons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Making a binary choice for a question asked by the device (1 button)</p></li>
<li><p>Moving in a menu (1 button)</p></li>
<li><p>Selecting a menu entry (2 buttons)</p></li>
<li><p>Proceeding with a disclaimer (2 buttons)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To propose a binary choice to the user, 2 glyphs representing the 2 choices should be
placed on each side of the screen (a cross symbol to cancel and a validation symbol to
accept).
You can display a question and relevant information in between the glyphs, like in the
upper example.</p>
<p>To move inside a menu, be it vertical or horizontal, the same technique is applied with
different glyphs. We recommend using arrows: up and down for a vertical menu, left and
right for a horizontal one).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id7">
<img alt="../_images/horizontal_menu.png" src="../_images/horizontal_menu.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Example use of arrows in an horizontal menu</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id8">
<img alt="../_images/vertical_menu.png" src="../_images/vertical_menu.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Example use of arrows in a vertical menu</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>Once positioned on the right menu entry, the user can select the entry by pressing both
buttons. This potential action is not represented by glyphs.
Same goes when going through a set of disclaimer screens: only text is displayed, and
the user goes to the next part by pressing both buttons.
This is a consistent behavior across the device, so you can assume that users are used
to it. It should feel obvious when the user has to press two buttons to go through
something in your app.</p>
<p>Ledger does not impose the icons nor the interface for third party applications, however user
friendliness and guidelines compliance is something being reviewed during the integration process.
Therefore, a very poor design might be a cause of delay in your release roadmap if the
outcome of the review is negative because of it. Don’t neglect it !</p>

<p>There are different release levels for a given application:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Public release</strong> (official Ledger support)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developer mode release</strong> (experimental support)</p>
<ul>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>In any case, Ledger’s decision to publish a third party application may not be considered as any form of partnership nor endorsement of such.</p>
</div>
<p>As long as an application isn’t audited by Ledger security team, the message <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pending</span> <span class="pre">Ledger</span> <span class="pre">Review</span></code> will be made visible when the application is started.
The user can aknowledge and skip this warning by pressing both buttons and use the application at his own risks.
As an unaudited application is considered experimental, such application will be visible <strong>only once the developer mode settings has been enabled</strong> in Ledger Live settings.</p>
<p>Some applications are also visible once the developer mode setting is enabled, not because of a lack of security review, but rather because they are considered too complex to use. A reason might be a the mandatory compatible GUI is missing, or the application purpose is considered too technical for the vast majority of users.</p>
<p>An application will be listed publicly (official Ledger support) once:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It passed the security audit</p></li>
<li><p>It’s been tested and validated by at least someone from Ledger Customer Success Team</p></li>
<li><p>The application is compatible with a GUI companion app (CLI is not enough)</p></li>
<li><p>Ledger is ready to communicate officially about the app release (tweet, blogpost, website page update)</p></li>
<li><p>Customer support pages are available on Ledger Help Center</p></li>
</ul>
